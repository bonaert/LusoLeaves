bodhi-dbf
========

This is an event-based dBase file parser for very efficiently reading data from *.dbf files based on the
[node-dbf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-dbf) package.

To get started, install the module using npm:

    npm install bodhi-dbf

and then `require` it as a function with an options object:

    var dbf = require('bodhi-dbf')(/* options */);

#Interface

The package presents an interface with one class (the `Parser`) and one function createParser

##Parser

This class is the main interface for reading data from dBase files. It extends `EventEmitter` and its output is via events.

###new Parser(path, /* options */)

* path `String` The full path to the .dbf file to parse

Creates a new Parser and attaches it to the specified filename.

    var parser = new dbf.Parser('/path/to/my/dbase/file.dbf');

###parser.on(event, listener)

* event `String` The event name to listen for (see below for details)
* listener `Function` The callback to bind to the event

This method is inherited from the `EventEmitter` class.

###parser.parse()

Call this method once you have bound to the events you are interested in. Although it returns the parser object (for chaining), all the dBase data is outputted via events.

    parser.parse();

###Event: 'start'

* parser `Parser` The parser object

This event is emitted as soon as the `parser.parse()` method has been invoked.

###Event: 'header'

* header `Header` The header object as parsed from the dBase file

This event is emitted once the header has been parsed from the dBase file

###Event: 'record'

* record `Object` An object representing the record that has been found

The record object will have a key for each field within the record, named after the field. It is trimmed (leading and trailing) of any blank characters (dBase files use \x20 for padding).

In addition to the fields, the object contains two special keys:

* @sequenceNumber `Number` indicates the order in which it was extracted
* @deleted `Boolean` whether this record has been deleted or not

This object may look like:

    {
        "@sequenceNumber": 123,
        "@deleted": false,
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Smith
    }

###Event: 'end'

* parser `Parser` The parser object

This event is fired once the dBase parsing is complete and there are no more records remaining.

##Usage

The following code example illustrates a very simple usage for this module:

    var dbf = require('bodhi-dbf')(/* {options} */)

    var parser = new dbf.Parser('/path/to/my/dbase/file.dbf');
    
    parser.on('start', function(p) {
        console.log('dBase file parsing has started');
    });
    
    parser.on('header', function(h) {
        console.log('dBase file header has been parsed');
    });
    
    parser.on('record', function(record) {
        console.log('Name: ' + record.firstName + ' ' + record.lastName); # Name: John Smith
    });
    
    parser.on('end', function(p) {
        console.log('Finished parsing the dBase file');
    });
    
    parser.parse();
